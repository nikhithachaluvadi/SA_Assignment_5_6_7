  1. We estimated around 5 hours to do this project, and then it took around 6 hours to complete this project. The installations took more time and so took 6 hours. Otherwise spending 5 hours is a good estimate for this project.
  2. The Automation API hyperlink is a link that is used to refer to another document, method calls, or anything else - which is useful for quick access to code/data and saves time looking for where the code/logic is located.
In HTML, for example, we utilize anchor tags with hyperlinks to redirect to another page. The same is true for API document referencing, which aids in redirecting to the correct code. We inject the hyperlink method calling capabilities to the current reference object in syntactical manner. If we click this object, we will be redirected to a special API that will allow us to quickly identify the code or document.
  <a HREF="reference_page_or_code">...</a>
  The page shown below shows multiple variables, methods, classes, and constructors, each with its own representation and syntax, as well as having its own hyperlinks that serve to redirect the referencing papers.

  3. Generated API reference using Doxygen and uploaded it to the submission link.
